# What Could Kodak Have Done Differently
- Kodak could have benefited from having an independent subsidiary in charge of digital technology, as suggested by the disruptive innovation theory.

- Would have allowed Kodak to match the Resources, Processes and Values needed for the digital technology, and overcome cognitive and action inertia.
