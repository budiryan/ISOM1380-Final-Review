# IDEO's Human Centered Design
IDEO is adopting a Human Centered Design method to develop new products.

# Main Elements of HCD
## Observation
The talents in the product developing team first raised the project-shopping cart enhancement and set a time frame of their design process, which was 5 days. They then addressed the problems with the current model, and further collected empirical evidence by going to the supermarket and observing people's shopping behaviors and interviewing them. They acted like anthropologists and shared their observations with photos and diagrams. The challenges include theft, child injury, and mobility of the shopping cart.

## Ideation
They formed different teams to design new models, trying to address the previously discussed problems. They drafted many different designs and selected the best ones.

## Prototyping
They built prototypes of their ideas in a very short period of time in different groups. Then they meet together to pitch their designs. With a spirit of "fail often", the IDEO polished their ideas until they become refined and mature. At this stage, they voted for the best ideas, with each team members' contribution to the vote instead of the dominance of the leader. In the last step, they combined all ideas into one model and made the final prototype.

## User Feedback
The team visited a supermarket to try their model and ask for feedbacks from the staff. They asked for advice and comments so that they could make further improvements (e.g. by iteration of the design process) and achieve business deals with businesses.
