# Ability to Innovate
## The Impact of Size and Structure
An organization's size and structure will impact its ability to generate innovation.

### The Impact of Size
#### Small and Flexible
- Best suited to idea generation
- Foster creativity and experimentation
#### Large and rule based
- Better investment decisions and more efficient implementation
- Enhance efficiency and coherence across R&D activities

#### Question: Is Bigger Better in terms of Innovating?
According to __Joseph Schumpeter__ (an Austrian Economist), Large firms would be more effective because:
- Obtain financing
- Spread costs of R&D over large volume
- Economies of scale
- Learning effect
- Take risk on large projects

However, large firms might also be __disadvantaged__ at innovation:
- R&D efficiency might decrease due to loss of managerial control
- Large firms have more bureaucratic inertia
- More strategic commitments tie firm to current technologies
Therefore, small firms often considered more flexible and entrepreneurial.

Key takeaway:
Small firms tend to be more innovative than larger firms in industries that are __younger__, __less concentrated__, __less capital intensive__, and __more reliant on skilled labor__.

### The Impact of Structure
#### Mechanistic Structures:
- Highly rule-based organization
- Good for operational efficiency, reliability
- Minimizes variation
- May stifle creativity
- Example company: __Dell__

#### Organic Structures:
- Limited rule-based organizations
- "Free flowing"
- Encourages creativity and experimentation
- May yield low consistency and reliability in manufacturing
- Example company: __Google__

#### Apple
Steve Jobs created a separate division within Apple with 20 of his __hand-picked people__ to create the Macintosh. Such divisions are called __"Skunkworks"__.

#### Lockheed Martin
__Skunkworks__ describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampared by bureaucracy, tasked with working on __advanced__ or secret projects.

The term come from Lockheed Martin's highly secretive facility that developed the first jet fighter in 143 days.

#### Example of Skunkworks
__GoogleX__, __Boeing Phantom Works__, __Amazon Lab126__

#### Stucture model: Centralization & Decentralization
##### Centralization
- Ensures projects match firm-wide objectives
- Avoid redundancy
- Maximize economies of scale
- Promotes Cooperation
- Example: Intel
##### Decentralization
- R&D activites are more market oriented
- Have better understanding of what the customers want
- Example: Microsoft
