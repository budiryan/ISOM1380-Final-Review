# The pros and cons of having a flexible & flat organization structure @ Google
## Pros
- Smaller teams have been known to be more innovative
- Avoid bureaucracy associated with a hierarchical structure
- "Cross-pollination" of ideas
- Google has an internal "market" where people vote on ideas - good idea bubble to the top

## Cons
- Difficult to manage as the organization grows larger
- Projects may become too diverse and unrelated to corporate strategy

# What kind of employees can it attract and retain?
- Attract employees who are innovative and creative
- However, there employees may also demand a lot of autonomy (independence
- Google also encourages people who have ideas to start up a company by connecting them with VCs
    + Google may end up taking a stake in these companies
    + These employees find it less risky to work @ Google and also work on the start up idea at the same time

# Can Google continue this style of working if it were faced with greater competition?
- Possibly, 
More competition would mean that there is a greater demand for innovation and hence a need for a flexible, fast organization
- On the other hand, Falling margins could lead to cost cutting and cancelling of policies such as the “20% time projects”
