# Traditional Product Development vs. Agile
## Traditional product development Approach
- Concentrates on thorough, upfront planning of the entire project
- Requires a high degree of predictability to be effective.

## Agile Development
- Relies on incremental, iterative development cycles to complete less-predictable projects
- Is ideal for projects in which requirements need to be discovered and new technology tested
- Focuses on active collaboration between the project team and customer representatives
